# PUBG Final Placement Predictions (Springboard Capstone Project 2)
This project is a part of the Springboard Data Science Career track. Other assignment files and capstone project can be found in a separate repository.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
PUBG is a game where up to 100 players start in match onto an island empty handed and must explore, scavenge and eliminate other players in a free for all until only one player/team is left standing. Kaggle has given us 65,000 games worth of anonymized data and we are asked to predict the final placement in a game given the in-game stats and initial player ratings. Kaggle has asked that we evaluate our model on Mean Absolute Error between the predicted win placement and the observed win placement.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
-- Random Forest
-- Deep Learning Neural Networks (Keras)
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

## Project Description
Within the last 2 years, Battle Royale (BR) styled video games have exploded in popularity, giving us new IPs such as Fortnite and Realm Royale and even affecting long standing franchises like Black Ops. This surge in numbers can arguably be traced back to PUBG, one of the first BR games to receive a substantial amount of development and sustain a large, consistent player pool. The premise of the game is simple: You and up to total of 100 players are dropped onto a large island empty handed and you must explore, scavenge and eliminate other players in a free-for-all/team vs team first person shooter styled battle until only one player or team is left standing. This project aims to use 65,000 gamesâ€™ worth of anonymized data to predict final placements in a game using over 20 different in-game stats. Using the data provided by kaggle found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction/data "here"), this project aims to build a predictive model using both an ensemble method and a deep learning neural net that can do just that.
